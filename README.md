# flightPricePrediction

This is a project on Flight Price Prediction based on Kaggle DataSet https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh. Below were the steps done on the dataset

***1. Did Data Clean-up </br>
2. Handled Missing Values </br>
3. Converted Date Ranges to Year, Month and Day </br>
4. Converted Time Ranges to Hours and Minutes </br>
5. Handled Categorical Data using One-Hot Encoding </br>
6. Did Exploratory Data Analysis </br>
7. Tried with different Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the Flight Price and choose Random Forest as the Final Algorith which gave the best accuracy.***

*** NOTE: *** As the Random Forest model size is high, I was unable to upload the pickle file. Feel free to download the code and run the script in your local machine to get the pickle file for Random Forest.
